# Multi-language URL

## Fieldtype module for ProcessWire 3.x

This module extends ProcessWire’s core FieldtypeURL and works basically 
the same as the other multi-language text fields in ProcessWire’s core. 
Because the module extends ProcessWire’s URL Fieldtype, it also 
supports all of the same features, but in a multi-language context.

### Requirements

- ProcessWire 3.0 or newer
- The core LanguageSupport and LanguageSupportFields modules must 
  already be installed. 

### How to install and use

- Copy the files included with this module to /site/modules/FieldtypeURLLanguage/.
- In the ProcessWire admin, go to Modules > Refresh. 
- Locate this module on the “Site” tab and click “install”.
- Create a new field and select “URL (multi-language)” as the type.
- You may also convert an existing URL or text field.
